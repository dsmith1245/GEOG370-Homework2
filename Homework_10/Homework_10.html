        <h1>Homework 10: Geoprocessing Analysis</h1>
        <h2>Davis Smith</h2>
        <h3>For this project, I asked the question "What areas of counties with many impoverished individuals are not near hospitals?" I asked this question for a few reasons. This topic allowed me to get easily manipulable data. It also resulted in some interesting visual information. I also didn't see that one of the tutorial videos involved hospitals in point layers, so I wanted to do something extra to go beyond the scope of that tutorial and show creativity.</h3>

        <h3>I started with a chloropleth map of North Carolina counties. I joined this county map with a census csv sheet that detailed poverty numbers per North Carolina county. I used a natural break classification and I used a ratio that divided the number of impoverished individuals per county by the total North Carolina population. Since I didn't normalize the data, population density still affects the results.</h3>

        <h3>I then selected the counties that had a value higher than .68% and saved that as a seperate layer. I also added the North Carolina hospital point layer.</h3>

        <h3>I then found the intersection of North Carolina hospitals and the isolated county layer. I added a buffer of 10 miles around the intersecting hospitals afterwards. I did 10 miles because of a study I found while researching for this project that showed how, for every roughly 5 miles increase in distance from a hospital, the chance of death turning transportation in an anbulence increases by 1%. I doubled the distance for visual interest.</h3>

        <h3>I used the difference geoprocessor to highlight the areas of the isolated counties outside of this 10 mile radius.</h3>

        <h3>Lastly, I displayed only the difference layer to show the exact area where hospitals are outside of a 10 mile range.</h3>
