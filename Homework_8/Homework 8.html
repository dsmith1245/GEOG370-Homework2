<h1>Homework 8: Normalization, classification, and census data ratios</h1>
<h2>Davis Smith</h2>
<p>The following maps show the number of workers whose work in agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, and mining in Georgia. The ratio used in these maps is the number or workers in these specific industries per 1000 workers in Georgia's total working population. I chose this data set because my previous chloropleth was already in percentages, so I downloaded, modified, and utilized another data set, but kept the same US state of interest. At the bottom of this webpage is a link to the new data set I used for this project. I chose this specific ratio because it made the most sense to compare a group of workers to a total working population rather than any other total population. </p>

<h2>Map 1</h2>

    <p>This map shows the data in an equal interval classification. This method is useful for evenly distributing the data, with each item in the legend being equally spaced out. However, the raw data itself is not evenly continuous, so the map is heavily weighted towards the lower end of the intervals. Additionally, I used a lot of intervals/classes so the color spectrum of the data is more diluted than probably necessary.</p>

<h2>Map 2</h2>

    </a>
    <p>This map shows the data in a natural breaks classification. This method is useful because it breaks the legend items in the natural breaks of the data set. The space between legend item is not quite as clean as the equal interval method, but the resulting chloropleth map shows a better range, compared the lower data-heavy equal interval map.</p>

<h2>Map 3</h2>

    </a>
    <p>This map shows the data in a pretty breaks classification. This method makes both the data as displayed in the legend and the range displayed in the chloropleth map easy to read and understand. However, like the equal interval classification, it also weighs the data to one extreme of the range, with it once again being the lower end of the data.</p>
